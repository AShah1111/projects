# Twitter Troll
In the directory twitter_troll is a notebook and dataset information for a project I was a part of that aimed to build a classifier to distinguish between Russian Troll Tweets and real human Tweets. This project incorporated AWS cloud services, Pytorch, Transformers (BERT), and Scikit Learn.

Thank you to FJ Fourie, Howey Qiu, Tom Shanahan and Bailey Wei for their contributions.
