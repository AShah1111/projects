A collection of projects and other works.

## Classifing Human Edited Images
`Identifying_Human_Edited_Images_using_a_CNN.pdf` contains a research paper showcasing my team's work on generating 'human-edited' images using a GAN. We then trained a CNN classifier on these GAN generated images and an 'unedited' GAN generated control set. 

## Twitter Troll
In the directory `twitter_troll` is a notebook and dataset information for a project I was a part of that aimed to build a classifier to distinguish between Russian Troll Tweets and real human Tweets. This project incorporated AWS cloud services, Pytorch, Transformers (BERT), and Scikit Learn.
